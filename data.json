At the higest level, Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling. People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook. If you believe you have symptoms of schizophrenia, and/or you have various risk factors that increase the likelihood of schizophrenia, please consult a family doctor and/or psychiatrist for a diagnosis and treatment plan specific for the individual."
